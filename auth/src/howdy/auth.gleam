//// Email-token, password and built-in provider authentication. This package owns its tables; applications
//// keep small facts in `howdy/auth/field` and anything relational in their own tables.
//// Authorization lives in howdy/authorization.
////
//// This module is the public face. Each flow is implemented under
//// `howdy/auth/internal`: `config` holds the configuration record and its one
//// constructor, `email_flow`, `password_flow`, `provider_flow`, `sso_flow`,
//// `passkey_flow`, `mfa_flow`, `account_flow` and `session_flow` hold the
//// operations, `labels` the stored method and ceremony names, and `common`
//// what several flows share. The types here are the ones applications see;
//// the flows return their `internal/types` twins, converted at this boundary.
