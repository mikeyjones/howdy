//// Rate limiting middleware.
////
//// Create a limiter once at startup, then attach it at any level with a
//// choice of how to identify the client.
////
//// ```gleam
//// let api = rate_limit.fixed_window(limit: 100, per_seconds: 60)
//// let writes = rate_limit.token_bucket(capacity: 10, refill_per_second: 1)
////
//// howdy.new()
//// |> howdy.middleware(rate_limit.by_ip(api))
////
//// controller.post("/", create |> middleware.wrap(rate_limit.by_header(writes, "x-api-key")))
//// ```
////
//// Counters live in an ETS table owned by the process that called the
//// constructor. Create limiters in `main`, not inside a handler.
//// A linked cleanup process expires old windows every window or minute,
//// whichever is shorter. It exits when the constructor's process exits.
//// Token buckets are evicted once they have refilled to capacity, which is
//// the same as not existing; a bucket is never evicted while it is short of
//// tokens. Sweeps run at most a minute apart.
////
//// Each limiter tracks at most `default_max_identities` distinct keys, which
//// `max_identities` adjusts. The bound is exact: a slot is reserved
//// atomically before a row is inserted, so concurrent first hits cannot
//// overshoot it. Keys over 64 bytes are stored as their SHA-256, so row size
//// is bounded too. Keys already in the table keep being limited even when
//// the table is full. A key not yet in the table is refused with
//// `Saturated`, so an attacker who can mint keys (a spoofed header, a large
//// IPv6 range) cannot grow memory without bound, and cannot switch limiting
//// off either. Trade-off: while saturated, new legitimate clients are
//// refused too, and room only returns when a sweep finds rows to evict.
//// Size the cap for your identity space.
////
//// Behind a proxy every request shares the proxy's IP, so use `by_header`
//// with the header your proxy sets rather than `by_ip`.
////
//// Those counters belong to one node: behind a load balancer each node allows
//// the full limit, and a restart forgets it. `shared` keeps a fixed window's
//// counts in a `Store` every node can reach, such as a database table, at
//// the cost of one round trip per request.
