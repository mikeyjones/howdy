//// WebSockets as ordinary routes.
////
//// A WebSocket starts life as a `GET` request, so it is added to a
//// controller like any other route and goes through the same middleware,
//// guard and versioning. The handler builds a socket description and
//// finishes with `upgrade`.
////
//// ```gleam
//// import howdy/websocket
////
//// controller.new("echo")
//// |> controller.get("/", fn(ctx) {
////   websocket.new(fn(_socket) { 0 })
////   |> websocket.on_text(fn(socket, count, text) {
////     let _ = websocket.send_text(socket, text)
////     websocket.continue(count + 1)
////   })
////   |> websocket.upgrade(ctx)
//// })
//// ```
////
//// Every callback runs in the connection's own process and receives the
//// `Socket` to send frames on, the current state, and returns what to do
//// next: `continue` with new state, or `close`.
////
//// Other processes can reach a socket through `subject`, and groups of
//// sockets through `howdy/websocket/channel`.
////
//// Browsers cannot set headers on a WebSocket handshake, so guards for
//// socket routes usually read a cookie or a query parameter instead.
