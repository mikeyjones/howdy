//// A development admin area for a Howdy app. Mount it from your `dev/`
//// entry point, and it appears at `/_howdy`:
////
//// ```gleam
//// import howdy/admin
//// import howdy/dev
////
//// pub fn main() {
////   let db = my_app.open_database()
////   let identity = my_app.identity(db)
////   let assert Ok(_) =
////     dev.start(fn() {
////       my_app.app(db, identity)
////       |> admin.mount(admin.new() |> admin.database(db) |> admin.auth(identity))
////     })
////   process.sleep_forever()
//// }
//// ```
////
//// Gleam has no way to find out which packages an app uses at runtime, and
//// no registry of the values it built, so the app hands the admin what it
//// has. What is registered decides what the admin shows:
////
//// - `database`: the tables of the Gloo Repo, on PostgreSQL or SQLite, in a
////   grid that refreshes as the data changes, with forms to insert, edit
////   and delete rows.
//// - `auth`: users and groups, creating and suspending users, moving them
////   between groups, and signing in to the app as any user. Registering
////   auth registers its database too.
//// - `authorization`: roles and their permissions, and which users hold
////   them, in every scope.
//// - `mail`: the messages a `howdy/mail/outbox` keeps, as they arrive.
//// - `mail_previews`: your email templates rendered from sample data, and
////   sent on demand.
//// - `telemetry`: the traces and log lines a `howdy/telemetry/recorder`
////   holds, as they happen: each request as a timeline of its queries,
////   remote calls and emails, with repeated and slow queries pointed out.
//// - `flags`: the feature flags of a `howdy/flags`: their kill switches,
////   who they are allowed or blocked for, their history with undo, and the
////   groups rules can name. Rollouts are shown, not set.
////
//// Some things need no registering, because `mount` can see them in the
//// app:
////
//// - The OpenAPI documents `howdy/openapi` serves: every endpoint, with a
////   form to call it and see the response. Calls go straight through the
////   app, anonymously or as any user when `auth` is registered.
////
//// ## Development only
////
//// There is no login: anyone who can reach the pages can read and change
//// every row and sign in as anyone. Keep `howdy_admin` a dev dependency,
//// mount it only from `dev/`, and serve it from `howdy/dev`, which listens
//// on loopback. The pages also refuse a request whose `Host` is not
//// `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` or `[::1]` unless `allow_hosts` says otherwise,
//// so a browser on another machine, or a DNS-rebinding page, gets `403`.
//// Writes must also come from the admin's own origin: a `POST` whose
//// `Sec-Fetch-Site` or `Origin` header says another site sent it gets
//// `403` too, so a page you visit while the admin runs cannot post to it.
