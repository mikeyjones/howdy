//// Feature flags, defined in code and switched while the app runs.
////
//// A flag is declared in code with its default, so it works with nothing
//// stored: in tests, on a fresh deployment, and on any node that has not
//// heard of a change yet. A store keeps only what someone changed:
////
//// - a kill switch, which turns the flag off for everyone at once;
//// - users, organizations and groups it is blocked for, or allowed for;
//// - a rollout: the share of users (or organizations) who get it, from 0
////   to 100%, optionally raised step by step on a schedule.
////
//// ```gleam
//// pub fn new_checkout() -> flags.Flag {
////   flags.flag("new_checkout", description: "Stripe-hosted checkout")
//// }
////
//// let assert Ok(store) = flags_database.store(db)
//// let assert Ok(features) =
////   flags.new(store) |> flags.register([new_checkout()]) |> flags.start
////
//// case flags.enabled(features, new_checkout(), for: flags.user(user.id)) {
////   True -> new_checkout_page(ctx)
////   False -> checkout_page(ctx)
//// }
//// ```
////
//// Checks read an in-memory copy of the settings and never touch the
//// store. Changes made on this node apply before the call that made them
//// returns; other nodes pick them up the next time they check for changes,
//// every two seconds unless `check_every` says otherwise.
////
//// ## Stores
////
//// Where the settings are kept is up to a `Store`:
//// `howdy/flags/database` keeps them in a Gloo Repo, `howdy/flags/memory`
//// in one process, and `store` builds one over anything else, such as a
//// service that manages the flags for you. A store without a writer is
//// read-only: the flags are changed wherever it gets them from.
////
//// ## Rollouts
////
//// Everyone has a position from 0 to 99.99% for each flag, worked out from
//// the flag's key and their id, so it never changes and needs nothing
//// stored. A rollout of 20% is on for everyone below 20%. Raising it only
//// adds people; lowering it takes away the most recently added first, so
//// rolling back from 20% to 5% leaves the first 5% as they were. Because the
//// key is part of it, a different 5% go first for each flag.
////
//// Rolling back a flag changes which code runs, not the data the new code
//// already wrote: the old path has to cope with it.
////
//// Management operations such as `set_rollout` are privileged: authorize
//// the caller first. Each is recorded in the flag's history under the name
//// given as `by`, and can be undone.
