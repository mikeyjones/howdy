# Howdy Auth compared with Better Auth

Reviewed 21 September 2026 against Howdy commit `9d59bbb` and Better Auth's
current official documentation. The working tree was clean at the start.
Enterprise federation/SSO, SAML and SCIM remain excluded as requested; their
presence in Howdy has not been evaluated here. Ordinary workspace membership is
considered separately because it also matters to non-enterprise SaaS products.
Better Auth plugin capabilities require installation/configuration, not just the
core package. Its online documentation is not a guarantee for every older release.

## Assessment

**Howdy is now close in core web-authentication workflow coverage, but still
substantially narrower as an integration platform.** The previous comparison
understates today's implementation. Password and account management, mainstream
social login, passkeys, MFA and stateful sessions no longer have major missing
categories. Matching every option, client integration and optional plugin remains
a different and larger objective.

For an Erlang/Howdy application using PostgreSQL or SQLite, the current feature
set is credible and broadly sufficient for ordinary browser authentication.
Better Auth still saves application developers more work around clients,
extensions, mobile, administration and alternative login experiences. Production
assurance cannot be inferred from matching feature names or counting tests.

## Previous gaps that are now closed

| Capability | Verified Howdy implementation | Assessment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Current-password change | `change_password` checks the current password, shares guessing limits, preserves the caller and revokes other sessions; sends a notice | Core workflow covered; no email round trip required |
| Old-mailbox approval | `with_email_change_approval` adds approval before verifying the new address; completion notifies the old mailbox | Core workflow covered |
| Passkey RP/origins | Parent-domain RP IDs and additional ceremony origins; tests cover subdomains and refusal of unlisted origins | Present; bundled HTTP transport still enforces its public Origin |
| Passkey autofill | Conditional mediation, challenge renewal and cancellation when explicit sign-in starts | Present in starter pages |
| Passkey signup | Signed-out WebAuthn ceremony followed by email proof; account and credential created atomically on exchange | Present; email remains mandatory rather than arbitrary onboarding hooks |
| Remembered MFA devices | Configurable lifetime and optional renewal; recovery-code count configurable | Previous fixed-duration/count gap closed |
| Session renewal | Sliding expiry with optional absolute ceiling, idle expiry and updated external-store contract | Present, opt-in |
| Account switching | Multiple accounts in one browser, explicit switching and logout fallback | Present, opt-in |
| Encryption-key rotation | `mfa.with_decryption_keys` / `connection.with_decryption_keys` open with earlier keys; `auth.reseal_mfa` and `connections.reseal` re-encrypt online. Ciphertexts stay unversioned: authenticated trial decryption keeps existing values readable without a migration | Closed, including rolling deployments; Better Auth versions its ciphertexts instead ([secret rotation](https://better-auth.com/docs/reference/security#secret-rotation)) |
| Apple login | Apple adapter, signed client-secret JWT, identity verification and POST callback handling | Present alongside Google, GitHub, Facebook and Entra |

[Apple](https://better-auth.com/docs/authentication/apple).

Registration, recovery, account deletion/cleanup, provider unlinking, scoped RBAC,
typed custom fields, trusted provisioning, suspension and session revocation were
already present. They must not be counted as missing in an updated assessment.

## Where Howdy remains weaker

### 1. Reusable frontend and mobile integration — high practical impact

The package offers typed Gleam operations, JSON endpoints and starter-page
JavaScript. It has no equivalent reusable browser SDK with typed errors, reactive
session state, framework bindings or mobile cookie/deep-link handling. Applications
with custom frontends must rebuild this glue. Better Auth supplies a
[client](https://better-auth.com/docs/concepts/client) and
[Expo integration](https://better-auth.com/docs/integrations/expo).

A small Howdy client handling signed-out, pending-MFA and signed-in states,
renewal and account switching would help more applications than another obscure
login method. Native bearer support already exists; the gap is integration work.

### 2. Email-login convenience — high user-visible impact

Howdy still asks users to paste a long emailed token. Built-in clickable magic
links and short primary email OTP are absent. Delivered MFA OTP is a second
factor, not a replacement for those login flows. Better Auth has optional
[magic-link](https://better-auth.com/docs/plugins/magic-link) and
[email-OTP](https://better-auth.com/docs/plugins/email-otp) plugins. Dedicated
reset-link UX is also absent, although password recovery itself works.

Username, phone, guest-to-registered/anonymous login and other specialized methods
remain missing; choose them from product requirements rather than aiming for an
unweighted plugin count. [Plugin catalog](https://better-auth.com/docs/plugins)

### 3. Operational controls — high impact before broader deployment

- **General HTTP rate limits remain per process.** Password/MFA guessing and
  email cooldowns are already persistent and shared. Better Auth can place its
  HTTP limit state in database, secondary or custom storage; its server API
  calls bypass that HTTP limiter. A shared Howdy limiter is useful before scaling
  to multiple instances. [Rate limiting](https://better-auth.com/docs/concepts/rate-limit)
- **Release/dependency readiness is still limited.** Howdy depends on a patched,
  vendored Jargon and `glasslock 1.0.0-rc1`, including internal parsing APIs.
  The README still requires stopping old instances before migrations and says
  the password dependency needs resolution before Hex publication. These are
  operational constraints, not evidence of a particular vulnerability.
  [Dependency notes](../auth/vendor/jargon/README.md), [installation](../auth/README.md#install-and-migrate)
- **The local test evidence is not a browser/device compatibility matrix.**
  Signed WebAuthn fixtures and a simulated DOM are valuable, but do not establish
  Safari/iOS/Android, real authenticators, credential-manager behavior or live
  Apple callback interoperability. Add real-browser tests and document supported
  devices/providers. No independent security review is established by this work.

### 4. Supported extension points and administration — medium impact

Howdy's functions are composable and include useful targeted callbacks. The
provider constructor is nevertheless marked internal; there is no general
supported endpoint/database hook or plugin contract. Its trusted administrative
functions also leave authorization, search/pagination and support interfaces to
applications. Better Auth supplies [hooks](https://better-auth.com/docs/concepts/hooks)
and a permission-controlled [admin plugin](https://better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin),
including impersonation. That plugin is not a bundled hosted dashboard.

This is a developer-experience gap, not absence of role-based authorization or
user suspension in Howdy. A documented provider contract and small administrative
API could close useful parts without building a large plugin framework.

### 5. Product-dependent capabilities — significant when needed

| Capability | Howdy difference | Better Auth reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Integration/API credentials | Bearer sessions exist, but no independent scoped API-key lifecycle with expiry and per-key limits | [API keys](https://better-auth.com/docs/plugins/api-key) |
| Shared workspaces | Each user belongs to one group, or has separate accounts per group; no one-identity/multiple-membership model, invitation lifecycle or teams | [Organizations](https://better-auth.com/docs/plugins/organization) |
| Ongoing provider API access | Provider access/refresh tokens are discarded; no packaged scope-management/token-refresh workflow | [Accounts](https://better-auth.com/docs/concepts/users-accounts) |
| Storage/platform choice | Erlang with Gloo PostgreSQL/SQLite; custom session adapter supplied by the app | Broader [database/adapters](https://better-auth.com/docs/concepts/database) and JS framework integrations |

These are not prerequisites for a normal Howdy browser app. API keys matter for
public APIs; memberships matter for collaborative SaaS; provider tokens matter
when accessing a user's external services rather than merely signing them in.

### 6. Smaller configuration and UI gaps

Howdy fixes TOTP to six digits/30 seconds and has fewer OTP/recovery/lockout knobs.
WebAuthn extensions, authenticator-policy selection and arbitrary pre-auth signup
hooks are not exposed. Required user verification and resident credentials are
intentional stronger requirements, not missing verification. Its signup retains
mandatory email ownership proof. [Better Auth MFA](https://better-auth.com/docs/plugins/2fa),
[passkey options](https://better-auth.com/docs/plugins/passkey)

Howdy's starter MFA setup still displays a manual key. It already exposes the
`otpauth` URI, so local QR rendering is a small useful UI improvement. Better
Auth's docs likewise demonstrate application-supplied QR rendering; this is not
an absent TOTP protocol feature or evidence of a supplied hosted UI.

## Strengths and differences worth preserving

Howdy gates enrolled MFA across its ordinary email/password/social/passkey
methods. Better Auth's documented default gates credential login, not all
passwordless/social methods. That is a meaningful policy distinction, not an
overall security ranking. Both have shared failed-MFA attempt protection.
[Better Auth enforcement](https://better-auth.com/docs/plugins/2fa)

Howdy also retains current account-state checks, session-token digests, explicit
linking and generation-based revocation for sensitive account changes. Its fresh
database checks cost reads, including with external sessions, but avoid the
staleness of optional cookie-cached session state. Better Auth documents that
cookie-cache revocation may remain stale until cache expiry. Do not add stateless
or cached sessions solely to match a checklist. [Session tradeoffs](https://better-auth.com/docs/concepts/session-management)

## Suggested next priorities

1. Dependency/release readiness and real-browser/device validation.
2. Shared HTTP rate limiting before multi-instance deployment.
3. A reusable auth client plus magic-link/short-email-code UX and local QR rendering.
4. Public provider/extension contracts and focused administrative tools.
5. API keys, memberships and more login methods only as required by the product.

Core workflow coverage is close; platform breadth remains substantially different;
production assurance requires evidence beyond this comparison. A single parity
percentage would conceal those distinctions.

## Verification and documentation

The auth suite was rerun for this review: **225 tests passed on SQLite and
225 on PostgreSQL**. The exact starter-page JavaScript passes **16 tests**, and
`examples/auth` passes `gleam check`. This is a feature
and implementation review, not an exhaustive vulnerability scan, performance
comparison, live-provider trial or full CI matrix run.

The README's old “Scope compared with Better Auth” paragraph incorrectly described
RP/origin configuration, autofill, signup and configurable device trust as missing.
It has been corrected alongside this comparison. Implementation behavior was
checked rather than inferred from that stale text. Additional primary-source
notes: [current research](betterauth-current-research.md).
