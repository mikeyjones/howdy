//// Write the CSS for a published site to a file.
////
//// The runtime route in `ui.stylesheet` only knows classes that have been
//// rendered, and differs between nodes. For publishing, write one file
//// from a known list of classes instead. Put a script module in your
//// project and run it with `gleam run -m tasks/css`:
////
//// ```gleam
//// // src/tasks/css.gleam
//// import howdy/ui/export
//// import howdy/ui/theme
//// import my_styles
////
//// pub fn main() {
////   let assert Ok(Nil) =
////     export.new(theme.default_themes())
////     |> export.classes(my_styles.all())
////     |> export.write(to: "priv/static/ui.css")
//// }
//// ```
////
//// The built-in components are always included. Serve the file with
//// `howdy/static` and link it from pages with `page.stylesheet`, adding
//// whatever cache-busting you use for other assets:
////
//// ```gleam
//// howdy.controller(static.new(from: "priv/static") |> static.at("/assets") |> static.max_age(seconds: 31_536_000) |> static.build)
//// ```
////
//// ```gleam
//// page.stylesheet(page, at: "/assets/ui.css?v=" <> my_app.version)
//// ```
////
//// The output is minified and deterministic: the same classes give the
//// same bytes on every machine, in the configured class-list order.
